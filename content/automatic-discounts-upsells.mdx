---

In 2016, we embarked on building Automatic Discounts & Upsells, a Shopify app designed to handle complex promotional strategies for e-commerce stores. The journey from concept to acquisition was both challenging and rewarding.

## Technical Architecture

The app was built using a microservices architecture with:

- NodeJS for the backend services
- MongoDB for flexible data storage
- Redis for caching and real-time operations
- AWS for cloud infrastructure

## Key Challenges & Solutions

### Scalability

Handling millions of requests per second required careful architectural decisions:

- Implemented microservices to distribute load
- Used Redis for caching frequently accessed data
- Optimized AWS infrastructure for cost efficiency

### User Experience

We focused on making complex promotional features accessible to non-technical users:

- Simplified UI for easy configuration
- Real-time preview of discount effects
- Automated testing of promotion rules

## Business Impact

The app was successfully acquired in a seven-figure deal, validating our technical and business approach. The acquisition process was featured on [They Got Acquired](https://theygotacquired.com/saas/tabarnapp-acquired-by-staytuned) and discussed on the [Startup Acquisition Stories Podcast](https://youtube.com/watch?v=i7H3s2WijHM).

## Lessons Learned

1. **Performance is crucial**: Even small latency improvements can significantly impact user satisfaction
2. **User feedback is gold**: Regular testing with real users helped shape the product
3. **Infrastructure costs matter**: Careful optimization of AWS resources saved significant operational costs

## The Book

The journey of building and selling Automatic Discounts & Upsells was documented in the book ["Fin heureuse: Comment vendre son entreprise"](https://www.amazon.ca/Fin-heureuse-vendre-entreprise-French-ebook/dp/B0D4GY36NW) (Happy Ending: How to Sell Your Business). The book provides insights into the acquisition process, sharing valuable lessons about preparing a business for sale, negotiating deals, and ensuring a successful transition.
