MooseSync was born from the need to reliably synchronize data between Shopify stores and external systems. Built between 2018-2021, this project showcased the power of Elixir for handling complex data operations.

## Technical Stack

- **Backend**: Elixir for its excellent concurrency handling
- **Database**: Amazon RDS for reliable data storage
- **Infrastructure**: AWS for scalable cloud hosting

## Key Features

### Data Synchronization

- Real-time data updates between systems
- Conflict resolution mechanisms
- Data validation and error handling

### Infrastructure Management

- Automated deployment pipelines
- High availability setup
- Performance monitoring and optimization

## Development Approach

The project started with a small team establishing best practices:

- Code quality guidelines
- Testing frameworks
- Deployment procedures

When the initial team transitioned, I took over the development:

- Completed key features
- Maintained system stability
- Optimized performance

## Lessons Learned

1. **Elixir's strengths**: Its concurrency model proved perfect for data sync operations
2. **Team transitions**: Clear documentation and processes are crucial
3. **AWS optimization**: Careful resource management is key to cost control
